### [src/680_schincke_project1.ipynb](src/680_schincke_project1.ipynb)

This notebook contains the main implementation of the project. It includes the following sections:

1. **Import Statements**: Import necessary libraries such as Polars, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
2. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from `data/creditcard_2023.csv`.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Check for null values and basic data structure.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
5. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Visualization**: Plot the results to visualize the performance of the models.

### [src/credit-card-detection.ipynb](src/credit-card-detection.ipynb)

This notebook is used for additional analysis and validation. It includes:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Similar preprocessing steps as in the main notebook.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate models to validate the results obtained in the main notebook.
